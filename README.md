# InstaScraper

Created this tool to analyze the follower/following ratios of users on Instagram.
followerScraper.py parses through my follower list and returns the usernames of my followers in an array.
infoScraper.py takes my follower list and enters profile information in a Dataframe. It then merges a baby names CSV file to assign male/female gender to each user.
